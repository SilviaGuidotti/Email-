# Email changing header
Email template - fashion industry - new collection

In this experiment I wanted to create a header able to change the picture based on the time of the day, using JS. 

if time > 17 ---> picture "evening";

if time > 12 ---> picture "afternoon";

if time > 0  ---> picture "morning";
